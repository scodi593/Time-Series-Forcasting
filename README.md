# Time-Series-Forcasting
In a data preprocessing project, I utilized Python, Keras, and Pandas to enhance the formatting of data for machine learning models. By employing techniques like feature scaling, encoding categorical variables, and handling missing values, I aimed to optimize the dataset for improved model performance. The success of the project was quantified through thorough evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, and recall, showcasing notable enhancements in the model's predictive capabilities. This meticulous approach to data preparation played a pivotal role in achieving a refined and well-structured dataset, contributing significantly to the overall success of the machine learning endeavor.
